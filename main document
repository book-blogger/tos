Terms of Service

General Terms
    By commissioning me, you agree to these terms and conditions.
  I reserve the right to refuse a commission if it conflicts with my listed content restrictions or if I feel uncomfortable with the request.
  Payments are required upfront or in installments (if agreed upon), depending on the size of the commission.
  I will not accept a commission based on text or verbal descriptions of character(s). Full-color reference sheets are required for all character-based commissions. This includes detailed visual references of your character's appearance, outfit, and any other relevant features.</li>
  Anonymous commissions are allowed. If you wish to remain anonymous, please let me know at the start of the commission, you will not be named or tagged if I post the artwork online.

Commission Process
  Once your commission is accepted, I'll provide an estimated date for completion.
  After receiving your payment, I'll start working on your commission depending on it's place in my queue.
  WIPs (Work-in-Progress) will be sent during the process, and you can request minor changes. Major changes will be discussed upfront before I proceed.

Payment
  Payment is typically made via CashApp or Ko-fi.**
  For commissions over $200, I may offer a payment plan. The commission will not be started until the first installment is paid.
    **We no longer publicly accept payment through PayPal due to their invasive terms of service and shady tacking tactics. Since users must use their legal name to own an account, we refuse to use the service regarding my business. This is to protect our safety, our family's safety, and other user's safety. We are reserving PayPal to only trusted friends and dire emergencies. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Refunds
  Refunds are not available once the commission is completed.
  If I need to cancel a commission due to unforeseen circumstances on my end, a full refund will be provided.

Copyright and Usage Rights
  You may not use my artwork for commercial purposes (e.g., selling prints, using the art for merchandise, etc.) unless previously agreed upon.
  You may not claim the artwork as your own or alter it without my permission.
  I retain the right to use the artwork for my portfolio, social media, and promotional purposes unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Personal Use
  You are free to use the artwork for personal use (e.g., profile pictures, printing for personal use), but commercial use must be discussed beforehand.

Revisions and Edits
  I will allow a reasonable number of revisions during the process (usually 2-3). If major changes are requested after the final piece is delivered, an additional fee may apply.
  Minor adjustments or corrections (e.g., color changes, small detail tweaks) can be made for free within a week of delivery.

Timeframe
  Commissions may take anywhere from one week to one month depending on complexity and workload. I will keep you updated on the progress, and you will be notified when the commission is started and completed.
  Rush orders may incur an additional fee and should be discussed before payment.

Proper Conduct
  Please be respectful and communicate clearly throughout the process.
  I reserve the right to cancel or refuse a commission if the client behaves in a disrespectful or inappropriate manner.

Content Restrictions
  I will only create artwork that adheres to my restrictions. Please refer to my list before commissioning to ensure your request falls within my boundaries.
  I do not create content involving hate speech or anything that violates my ethical guidelines.

Communication
  I will communicate with you through email or bluesky. It's important that you provide clear, detailed references and descriptions for your commission to avoid any misunderstandings.

Finished Project Delivery
  Once the commission is completed, the final artwork will be sent to the email you provide during the payment process. Please ensure your email is accurate and accessible for file delivery.
